# Contribute

Contributions welcome!

Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!

Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating
efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions
are welcome:

* Ideas: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
* Writing: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included docs.
* Copy editing: fix typos, clarify language, and improve the quality of the docs.
* Formatting: help keep docs easy to read with consistent formatting.
